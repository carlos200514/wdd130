        Another thing is my favorite city is because I met many people there that support me and my different companions
        in many situations so this city have a great people and finally I like the various ways of transportation that
        the city have, but one I liked more it was the "Tuc-tuc", a three weel motorcycle with a cabin for the people
        so Santa Lucia have many thins that I enjoyed very much.
