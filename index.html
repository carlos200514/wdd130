            Hello! my name is Carlos Felipe Rojas, but I prefer my middle name "Felipe", I'm from Heredia, Costa Rica.
            I'm a person very kind and patience, I like video-games, movies specially the "Star Wars" movies, also
            I like many types of music but I prefer rock music, like "Imagine Dragons", "AC/DC", etc, other thing I like
            the nature so I love to do hikes on a mountain or do sightseeing on a zoo, places like that, and finally I
            love technology, I like that sort of things about robots and programming.

        <p>
            Costa Rica is a beautiful country specially for their beaches that are very famous another thing that is
            very attractive for the people is their diversity in flora and fauna; another point is that the people from
            Costa Rica is very kind, and that's good for the tourist also for Costa Rica the education is very important
            so the majority of the people have a basic knowledge in everything including a basic understanding of
            English.
